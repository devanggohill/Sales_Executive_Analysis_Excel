📊 Dashboard


🔍 Project Insights
Jagdish Chandra had the highest sales (389), followed closely by Rachita Anupam (385).

Prabha Desikan achieved the highest target hit percentage (34.20%).

Omprakash O was the farthest from the target (71.40% away).

All executives have varying performances across different metrics, with noticeable gaps in achieving targets.

Contribution of each executive to overall sales is nearly evenly distributed (~20-21%).

✅ Final Conclusion
To boost sales productivity, it's crucial to focus on improving the target achievement rate. Executives like Omprakash O and Pankaj Shelkey, who are farthest from targets, may benefit from targeted training or revised sales strategies. Consistent performers like Jagdish Chandra and Prabha Desikan can be studied to replicate their techniques across other regions. The dashboard provides a quick, interactive way for managers to monitor and take action.
