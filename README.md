# Interactive Dashboard Creation Using MS Excel

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the **performance of sales executives** across various regions. This interactive Excel dashboard enables management to evaluate individual performance, track sales trends, and identify areas for improvement â€” helping make data-driven decisions for boosting sales outcomes.

## Dataset Used

The dataset for this analysis is available [here](https://github.com/devanggohill/Sales_Executive_Analysis_Excel/blob/main/Sales%20Executive%20Analysis.xlsm).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The analysis was focused on answering the following questions:

- **Who are the top-performing sales executives** based on total sales?
- **Which region** generates the most revenue?
- **What is the target hit %** for each executive?
- **Which executives are farthest from reaching their targets**?
- **Monthly/quarterly trends** of sales across executives.
- **Which executive has the highest average deal size**?
- **Distribution of sales performance** via charts and visuals.
- **Comparison of sales performance** between different dashboards/regions.

## Dashboard Interaction

The interactive dashboard allows users to filter and analyze executive performance by region. You can view the dashboard screenshot [here](https://github.com/devanggohill/Sales_Executive_Analysis_Excel/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20120013.png).

## Process

The following steps were taken to ensure a structured and effective analysis:

1. **Data Verification**: Checked and corrected any anomalies, inconsistencies, or missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured proper formatting and validated key fields like sales numbers and target data.
3. **Pivot Tables**: Created pivot tables for various KPIs across different regions.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Combined all insights into a unified Excel dashboard using slicers, bar charts, pie charts, and line charts for dynamic interaction.

## Project Insights

- **Top Performer**: *Jagdish Chandra* achieved the highest total sales (389 units), followed closely by *Rachita Anupam* and *Miny Mole*.
- **Target Achievement**: *Prabha Desikan* recorded the highest target hit % (34.20%), while *Omprakash O* was farthest from target (71.40% away).
- **Regional Filtering**: Dashboards are categorized by regions such as Surat, Pune, Delhi, etc., enabling localized analysis.
- **Even Distribution**: Sales performance is relatively evenly distributed among the top 5 executives (~20-21% each).

## Final Conclusion

To enhance sales performance, the company should provide focused training and support to underperforming executives, particularly those significantly away from target like *Omprakash O* and *Pankaj Shelkey*. High-performing executives like *Jagdish Chandra* and *Prabha Desikan* should be acknowledged and used as benchmarks for improving sales strategies. The dashboard provides a quick, interactive view for ongoing monitoring and strategic action.
